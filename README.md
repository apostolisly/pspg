# pspg - Postgres Pager

Everybody who uses `psql` uses `less` pager. It is working well, but there is not any special
support for tabular data. I found few projects, but no one was completed for this purpose.
I decided to write some small specialized pager for usage as `psql` pager.


## Main target
* possibility to freeze first few rows, first few columns
* possibility to use fancy colors - like `mcview` or `FoxPro`
